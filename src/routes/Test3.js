      <ul>
        <li>
          The list should have a solid black border and 20px of space between
          the border and the comments, on every side
        </li>
        <li>
          Each comment should have 15 pixels of space in between it and the next
          comment
        </li>
        <li>
          Each comment should have a light gray border, a 4 pixel border radius,
          and 10px of padding
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a circular user avatar to each comment to the left of the author's
          name and the text of the comment
        </li>

          data, and should contain the user's first and last initial in
          uppercase
